# Implementation Status and Forward Gates

This file is the durable execution ledger for the milestones defined in
`project-plan.md`. Update it in the same change that adds implementation or
verification evidence. A milestone is complete only when every exit criterion
has reproducible evidence.

Status values:

- `pending`: not started or no implementation evidence
- `in_progress`: implementation exists but exit evidence is incomplete
- `done`: exit criteria are covered by code, tests, and reproducible commands
- `blocked`: external input or state is required

| Declarative evolution artifact schema | done | version metadata and direction-aware regression rules |
| README/status claims match implementation | done | current milestone claims are separated from deferred production-blueprint features |

## M1: Web Gold Path

| Deliverable / exit criterion | Status | Evidence or next action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local pricing fixture with canonical oracle | done | `/pricing`, `/api/pricing`, reset endpoint, and oracle test |
| Playwright-compatible pre/post observer | done | plan, immediate-preflight, and post-action observations |
| DOM affordance builder and executor | done | semantic page revision, target fingerprint, leases, and DOM executor |
| Scripted planner through `PlannerPort` | done | deterministic `PricingPlanner` |
| RunCoordinator and multi-step RunState | done | serial coordinator, transitions, budgets, evidence, and recovery boundaries |
| Post-action structural verifier | done | DOM verifier runs against post-action HTML |
| Artifact store and complete run layout | done | run JSON, JSONL events, observations, screenshots, receipts, verification reports, hashes |
| One-command CLI gold path | done | `affordance-runtime run --target ... --artifacts ...` |
| Direct Playwright baseline | done | `affordance-runtime baseline --target ...` |
| Repeated pricing run and stale perturbation evidence | done | three consecutive Chromium runs passed; deterministic drift test blocks stale execution |

## M2: Runtime Reliability and Cross-Surface Proof

| Deliverable / exit criterion | Status | Evidence or next action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Settings and export fixtures | done | real settings persistence/API oracle and approved report download/file-hash/audit oracle |
| Drift/modal/delay perturbation controls | done | target replacement, selector drift, async enablement, blocking modal, transient API error, and delayed download are deterministic fixture controls |
| Scoped capabilities and approval gate | done | explicit capability plus single-use bound approval; unapproved Chromium export stops in `WAITING_APPROVAL` |
| Bounded recovery integrated into coordinator | done | execution/preflight/verification failures enter the deterministic recovery policy within budgets |
| Shared DOM/SoM/WoT contract execution path | done | all three surfaces pass the same coordinator, contract, trace, and verifier path in tests |
| Benchmark runner with independent oracles | done | executable local runner uses pricing JSON, settings API, export audit/file hash, and perturbation labels |
| JSON, Markdown, and CSV reports | done | `BenchmarkReportWriter` and format tests |
| Direct/primitive/full baselines and required ablations | done | fixed-seed 3 scenarios × 7 variants execute through the CLI and emit reports |
| Zero unsafe side effects under the suite | done | Full Runtime report: success 1.0, constraint violations 0.0, unsafe side effects 0.0; disabling capability gate produces the expected unsafe export signal |

## M3: Assisted Harness Evolution

| Deliverable / exit criterion | Status | Evidence or next action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Failure taxonomy classifier | done | typed seven-class classifier maps benchmark/trace evidence and is tested |
| Typed declarative proposals | done | typed artifact types, proposal schema, applicability, source trace, negative examples, and validation plan |
| Quarantine/version/rollback registry | done | atomic JSON registry store, accepted-only loading, version history, runtime unload, persisted rollback proof |
| Direction-aware regression gate | done | higher/lower-is-better thresholds, allowed regression, missing-metric quarantine tests |
| Replay-category accounting | done | decision requires original, family, global-smoke, and safety-smoke evidence |
| Executable artifact applied before fresh replay | done | SHA-bound verifier payload is loaded into a fresh no-verifier candidate before six real Chromium runs |
| One real failure before/after report | done | no-verifier settings false accept is fixed; original/family/global/safety replay passes with no unsafe regression |

## M4: Optional Integrations

| Deliverable / exit criterion | Status | Evidence or next action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Stable task-level API | done | `TaskRuntimeService` supports submit, execute, status, scoped approval, cancel, result, evidence, and trace |
| Parent agent cannot bypass runtime with public primitive actions | done | `TaskToolAdapter` exports only eight task-level operations; click/type/observe are absent |
| Local working integration | done | `LocalScenarioTaskRunner` connects the task API to real Chromium scenarios |
| Real external parent-agent integration | pending | no MCP/Codex/Claude/OpenHands/LangGraph caller has exercised it |
| Evidence and trace retrieval | done | adapter returns artifact paths and parsed JSONL events |
| Optional PiP decision gate | done | deferred: no measured observer/takeover need justifies another UI surface |

## M5-M9 Forward Gates

| Milestone | Required evidence |
| --- | --- |
| M5 | done: CI, package build, environment identity, clean-checkout command, and versioned benchmark/evolution summaries at `4528f25` |
| M6 | done: executable payload, fresh candidate runtime, mandatory replay, persisted decision, and rollback at `4cccc96` |
| M7 | real parent-agent submission/approval/cancel/result/evidence/trace with no primitive GUI bypass |
| M8 | distinct seeds, unseen layouts, repeated pinned MiniWoB++ subset, real visual grounding |
| M9 | only after a failing restart/waiting case; simple durable state/events and uncertain-effect inspection |

### MiniWoB++ Compatibility Evidence

On 2026-07-20, official Farama commit
`eb59fed60fabe8951350275ba8650633b740013b` was served from an isolated
temporary directory on sl09. The real `click-button` page was converted by the
DOM adapter into an Affordance, executed as an ActionContract through
`DomExecutor`, and returned:

```text
WOB_DONE_GLOBAL = true
WOB_RAW_REWARD_GLOBAL = 1.0
```

This proves one-task compatibility, not an integrated benchmark. Episode
reset/reward adaptation, repeated tasks, reports, and thresholds remain M8 work.
